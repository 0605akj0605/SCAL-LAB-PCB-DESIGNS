SCAL LAB: PCB Design – Automated Cooking Stove (Practice Projects)
This repository contains PCB design practice work initially intended for an automated cooking stove project. Although the final implementation using a PCB was not pursued, the repository includes schematic and board layouts for practice circuits developed during the exploration phase.

Tool Used: Autodesk EAGLE EDA

🚀 Project Collaboration
Worked in collaboration with Naman Jain and Chiranjit Saha to explore the integration of an IoT network for an automated gas stove. The system comprised:

Temperature Sensor

Humidity Sensor

Servo Motor

Spark Plug

These components were part of the intended control logic to automate ignition and cooking parameters.

🧩 Schematic Design
Below is one of the circuit schematics created using EAGLE:
