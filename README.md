SCAL LAB: PCB-DESIGN

Practice designs to design and implement the PCB for automated cooking stoves.

Unfortunately, the original Idea of having a PCB for the cooker was dropped and I have uploaded some designs I made for other circuits for practice here.

Tool used: -EAGLE EDA.


Worked with Naman Jain & Chriranjit Saha to integrate the IoT network comprising of temperature sensor, humidity sensor, servo motor and spark plug essential for automated gas stove functioning.
