# SCAL LAB: PCB Design – Automated Cooking Stove 

This repository contains PCB design practice work initially intended for an automated cooking stove project. Although the final implementation using a PCB was dropped, the repository includes schematic and board layouts for circuits designed during the exploration and learning phase.


## 🔧 Tool Used

- [Autodesk EAGLE EDA](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview)

## 🤝 Collaborators

Worked with **Naman Jain** and **Chiranjit Saha** to conceptualize and partially prototype an IoT-enabled automated gas stove. The system architecture included:

- 🔥 Spark Plug  
- 🌡️ Temperature Sensor  
- 💧 Humidity Sensor  
- 🔁 Servo Motor

These components were to be integrated for automatic gas ignition and control based on environmental conditions.

## 🧩 Practice Circuit Schematic

One of the practice schematic designs is shown below:

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced

- PCB Schematic & Layout Design
- EAGLE Board Design Workflow
- IoT Hardware Integration
- Collaborative Design Planning

## 📌 Disclaimer

These PCB designs were created for educational and practice purposes only and are not part of a finalized or fabricated product.
